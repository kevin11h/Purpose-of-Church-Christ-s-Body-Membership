# Purpose-of-Church-Christ-s-Body-Membership

ns of something
03:40
supernatural going on there
03:42
so there's something we can't just be
03:45
out sharing the gospel on our own
03:49
that wasn't god's plan there was
03:51
something
03:52
about the witness the testimony of his
03:55
body
03:55
this would be something the world hadn't
03:57
seen and so
03:59
absolutely should we all be out in the
04:02
world and
04:03
have relationships with these people and
04:05
and share the gospel
04:07
on our own amen i would just add to that
04:11
that i'm just
04:11
learning that unless there's a
04:14
a church that is living
04:18
you know we're calling them because
04:19
we're they're not
04:21
being saved just into a relationship
04:24
with god
04:25
it's as christ is our head and we are
04:28
his body you're being called
04:30
into a body and that's why everything we
04:33
teach
04:33
i feel is so significant is because for
04:37
too many years we've been calling people
04:39
into a personal relationship with jesus
04:42
and the reason is because the church
04:45
hasn't
04:45
been a body it hasn't even been a
04:49
family um it's just been a place where
04:53
people go
04:54
to hear the word and
04:57
that's not bad but don't call that a
04:59
church and
05:00
i don't call that a body uh if you're
05:03
not
05:04
feeling the pain that your arm is
05:06
feeling over there
05:07
um christ has called us into something
05:11
so amazing you know that ephesians 5
05:14
passage still closed my mind that
05:17
ah it's like god give me faith to
05:19
believe this from the core of my
05:21
being that we are members of your body
05:25
that is such an intense statement
05:29
when he says i'm a member of his body
05:31
and he
05:32
nourishes and cherishes me like i would
05:36
a member of my body jesus says that to
05:39
me
05:40
that's no little side note or acute
05:43
analogy
05:45
uh that is has
05:48
come on himself and so now we have to
05:51
equally
05:53
uh believe that about one another to
05:55
where dude if you're
05:56
ever in need of anything man i count it
06:00
as
06:01
the same as me feeling that same
06:04
need um that's what he wants of us and i
06:07
believe that's what we have
06:09
and and so if i can
06:12
see god create that again here in hong
06:14
kong i just think
06:16
um that's that's what's gonna people
06:19
according to his work
